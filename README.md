⚡ Key Features

Infinity Scroll Engine: Open files larger than 10GB instantly. The app uses advanced File Slicing API to read only the visible chunks of data into memory (RAM).

Privacy First: 100% Local Execution. Your log files never leave your device. They are processed within the browser sandbox. No data is uploaded to any cloud.

JSON Prettifier: Automatically detects JSON objects in log lines and formats them into readable trees with a single click.

Warp Jump Bookmarks: Mark important lines and "warp" between them instantly, even if they are gigabytes apart.

Focus Mode: Filter out noise and display only lines matching your search query.

Zero Install: Works on Desktop, Mobile (Android/iOS), and Tablets. Ideal for emergency debugging on the go.

🛠️ How It Works

Traditional editors (Notepad++, VS Code) try to load the entire file into RAM. If a file is larger than your available memory, the application crashes.

Log Voyager acts like a video streaming service but for text:

It creates a virtual map of the file.

It reads only a tiny buffer (50KB) corresponding to the scrollbar position.

When you scroll or jump, the old buffer is discarded, and a new one is read from the disk.

This ensures consistent performance whether the file is 5MB or 50GB.

🛡️ Security Note

It does not send analytics or file content to any external server.

It uses standard HTML5 File APIs strictly within the browser context.
